# TLDR
Chrome Extension for Summarizing Links


#### This project is split up into 2 parts:
* Chrome Web Extension
* Python Text Processor

#### The Chrome Extension
This is an example of what TLDR output on Reddit might look like, by loading this extension into Chrome 
we can visualize getting the TLDR of the next reddit link before going to it, helping us navigate in a way
that allows us to read the posts that interest us the most.

This represents what the web could be moving towards when it comes to written consumption. The same idea can be
applied to Facebook articles or another source, bypassing clickbait or things we may not want to view.

#### The Text Processor
This represents the "Back End" of this marriage. Taking an input of a URL, the processor is able to look over the article and
return a summary of what the user would see. This includes:
* A verbal summary of the text in the next link.
* Sentiment Analysis to gauge the emotional affect of the next link. (In development)
* A score representing the factual validity of the information on the next link. (In development)
